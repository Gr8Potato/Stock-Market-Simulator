# Abstract
We plan on making a stock market simulation with prices that fluxgate with an Monte-Carlo based algorithm to simulate economic trends. The user will be able to input new stocks with starting values as well as a volatility value that can predict the magnitude of price fluctuations over time. The user will then be able to create a portfolio in order to interact with the stock market they've created. 

The logical schema would consist of the stock ticker, current price, as well as a price history, allowing for trend analysis. The user portfolio would include attributes such as their name, the stocks they own and their shares, the buy/sell prices at the time (which would also be explicated) they bought it and the current price.
