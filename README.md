# Stock-Market-Simulator
This is a stock market simulator I've made with a team for a capstone project.

## Abstract
We plan on making a stock market simulation with prices that fluxgate with an Monte-Carlo based algorithm to simulate economic trends. The user will be able to input new stocks with starting values as well as a volatility value that can predict the magnitude of price fluctuations over time. The user will then be able to create a portfolio in order to interact with the stock market they've created. 

The logical schema would consist of the stock ticker, current price, as well as a price history, allowing for trend analysis. The user portfolio would include attributes such as their name, the stocks they own and their shares, the buy/sell prices at the time (which would also be explicated) they bought it and the current price.

I've privated the original repo in order to preserve the PII of myself. That said, their names and roles are listed below to give credit to the team that worked on this.
